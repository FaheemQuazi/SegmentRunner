## Description

We developed a version of Gravity Guy for the DE0-CV FPGA Development Kit. It utilizes the 7 segment displays as a game screen,
where the bottom segments are the "floor" and top segments are the "ceiling". The player is a single vertical segment.
with a button press, the player can move between the floor and ceiling segments, and the goal is to stay wherever there is a floor or ceiling.
